# webPortfolio
Basic web portfolio starter code that includes work samples, resume, about me, and contact.

As a student at NSCC I am looking forward to learning how to use CMS next year. For this project I only used HTML, CSS (with layout using mainly flexbox), and JavaScript.

Ways that I could improve this site and learn from my mistakes:
- Design for Mobile first, and then expand along breakpoints to the Desktop view. 
- There are a few issues with the layout when it comes to being responsive that need to be improved upon, such as text being consistanly styled using the em property. 
- I would add more white space aorund the elements to cut down on the cluttered feeling and to enhance the user's experience by giving the web page a more natural flow.
