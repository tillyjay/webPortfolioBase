        *Record Scratch* *Freeze Frame* Yep that’s me, Tilly Jay Campbell. You’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. 
        Let’s rewind 29 years. I was one of those rare millennials who grew up without the internet or even video games, but man was I 
        ever on good terms with the local librarians. So how did I become interested in tech? That comes later. 
      </p>

        Let’s skip grade school and jump to post university, where I would spend the better part of the next decade travelling and working as I went along. 
        Some call it wanderlust, others call it bad planning. Either way it forced my innately introverted self to develop certain interpersonal skills such 
        as effective communication, collaboration, and empathy. In hindsight, my personal development will always be grateful. 
      </p>

        Fast forward to 26. I’m working a job I love as an assistant for people with intellectual disabilities, but in terms of a career I felt lost. Que stumbling 
        across a basic HTML/CSS course, and the fascination that came with it. 
      </p>
        <br>
      <p id="fourthAP" class="aboutP">
        Soon after, I made the decision to apply to NSCC’s IT web development program, and here we are. Highlights of my education so far have been spending 9 hours
        to automate a 1-minute task… In all seriousness though, I’ve become passionate about programming, and in particular the aspect of UI. My work is by no means 
        pixel perfect, but I’m stoked about continuously improving my skills, and the avenues they may open.
