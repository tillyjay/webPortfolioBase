                        <p class="modalP">
                            The application is an interface where the user can select three different 
                            cat characteristics and the app will match you with the perfect cat.
                            The site is desktop and mobile friendly.
                            <br><br>
                            The app was created using JavaScriptâ€™s fetch function to grab data from an API, 
                            sort and filter it with three separate JS array methods to return a selected piece of data.
                            The app also leveraged a jQuery library and was styled entirely using SASS.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Working with an API was a challenging new experience but was a great exercise in working with data. 
                            Additionally, this was my first-time using SASS; a bit of a learning curve, but I now understand why 
                            incorporating variables into styling can be super beneficial in writing concise code.

                            This application is a dynamic social media feed with different users who each had unique administrative permissions for the feed, 
                            such as the ability to add users, or moderate posts.  
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Based off an ERD connected to a dynamic MySQL database, a customizable interface was created using Php and the Laravel framework. 
                            The application also included a touch of JavaScript for form validation and was styled using the Bootstrap framework. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This application pushed me out of my comfort zone by combining various techniques and frameworks. It was really cool to work with not only front-end code, 
                            but also pull back and work with back-end development.

                                This infographic was created to explain and provide examples of key design principles. The infographic included boxed information with graphic examples 
                                of each principle upon hovering over a section.
                                <br>
                                <br> 
                                Although rather simplistic in skill only using HTML and CSS for styling, each design principle was written in my own words and required me to think critically about how these 
                                principles affect web development. 
                                <br>

                                Regardless of the simplicity, this infographic was perfect for practicing flexbox and learning more about effective design.

                        <p class="modalP">
                            This application was designed to repeatedly fetch real-time flight transit 
                            data from an API, then filter the data to only include Canadian data points. 
                            The Canadian data points are then displayed on a map using Leaflet.js.    
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            JavaScript was used to fetch fresh JSON data from an API every 3.5 seconds and filter it based on the country of origin.
                            Using the map method to transform the filtered data into a geoJSON object, 
                            and then output to DOM values of the flight properties using template literals and interpolation.

                            This application helped to familiarize myself with the DOM and working with real time dynamic data. It also helped me to have 
                            a better understanding of objects and how to manipulate them.

                            This website is modeled after an HR Employee database. The site includes an authenticated user login to an 
                            interface that allows for the viewing, searching, inserting, updating, and deleting of employee records. 
                            There is even an opt-in/opt-out of employee benefits and pagination of employee records. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            PHP was used to create the site (along with all of the modification capabilities) and connects to a MySQL 
                            database. Throughout the site Javascript was used to create forms (such as the user login) with the appropriate 
                            client side validation and hashed passwords. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            If I were to recreate this site, I would clean up my code by making the information within the JavaScript
                            forms fixed variables and not changeable data fields. This would ensure that updating and deleting functions 
                            would always correspond with correct employee number, without room for human error.

                            This site imitates the popular Pinterest website with its search bar menu and page full of images 
                            that each lead to a topic in more detail. The site even includes a user page, as well as the ability
                            to favourite and download images. The site is desktop and mobile friendly.

                            <br>
                            This site is pure HTML and CSS, with the main focus on the use of CSS cards in various styles
                            throughout the pages. The homepage also transforms the cards making them clickable links with a 
                            hover overlay effect. All positioning was completed using Flexbox. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It was a lot of fun to replicate the fundamentals of a site and then add my own personal flair. 
                            I reall enjoy being given specifications with creative liberties.
